# Python CI policy

Pull requests use pairwise compatibility coverage so the required gate can run
horizontally:

- Python 3.14 runs the complete suite on Windows in four duration-balanced
  shards.
- Python 3.13 runs complete branch coverage on Ubuntu in three shards.
- Python 3.11 and 3.14 run the complete suite on Ubuntu.
- Python 3.11 and 3.13 run focused installation, import, path, subprocess, and
  API compatibility checks on Windows.

The scheduled and manually dispatchable `Full Python compatibility matrix`
workflow remains the complete OS-by-Python backstop. This is deliberately a
pairwise PR policy, not equivalent to running the complete suite on every
combination before merge.

## Shard safety

`.github/scripts/ci_pytest_shard.py` collects the eligible tests on every
runner. Historical timings influence balance only: a new or unknown test is
always assigned to a shard. `test-verify` compares exact node-ID sets and fails
if a test is omitted, duplicated, or collected differently by two shards.

The checked-in Windows timing model contains the slow observations from a
successful `main` run. Every shard emits fresh exact-node timing evidence for
future model refreshes. Stale entries are harmless and missing entries use the
conservative default weight.

## Exhaustive recovery policy

Every code pull request retains representative before/after, repository-role,
and first/last checkpoint recovery cases. The full interruption permutation
set runs when ticket-board code or tests, shared Git infrastructure, test
configuration, dependency configuration, or CI orchestration changes. Unknown
paths fail safe to the exhaustive set. Main pushes and the full scheduled
matrix also run every recovery permutation.

## Performance telemetry

The fixed `ci-metrics` job runs after `ci-required` and records workflow queue
time, completed-job queue percentiles, consumed runner time at observation, a
rounded job-minute estimate, and workflow elapsed time. The only job absent
from that total is the metrics collector itself. It writes the measurements to
the job summary and keeps the JSON artifact for 90 days. Performance evaluation
uses at least 20 code-changing runs and includes queue time rather than
considering job runtime alone.
